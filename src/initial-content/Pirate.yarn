You wake up to the sound of seagulls cawing and the salty smell of the sea breeze wafting through your window. Today feels different (and its not just the hangover), as if the wind itself is whispering tales of distant lands and treasures untold. You've spent your life in the small coastal town of Marrow's End, listening to old sailors' tales of the high seas. But today, the call of adventure is too strong to ignore. With nothing but a satchel of essentials (mostly flour, for some reason), and a heart full of dreams (mostly treasure), you set out towards Port Bellylaugh, where ships big and small anchor, waiting for those brave enough to seek their fortune. Will today be the day you leave your old life behind and start anew on the path of adventure?

<<declare $returns_home = false>>

-> Head to Port Bellylaugh, your spirit alight with the promise of adventure and heartburn.

title: Dawn_of_Decisions
---
Dawn breaks over the quaint Port Bellylaugh as you arrive, your mind abuzz, pondering your existence. Life here is simple, yet a restless spirit stirs within you, longing for the unknown. The stories of old sea dogs and the treasures they've sought and sometimes found echo in your mind like a siren's song. Today, you feel, is the day for a change. Will you heed the call of the unknown, or will your feet lead you down a different path?
-> Embrace the call of the sea and head to the ships.
    <<jump The_Call_of_Adventure>>
-> Wander the village to clear your head and decide your future.
    <<jump A_Village_Walk>>

===

title: A_Village_Walk
---
<<if $returns_home == false>>
You decide to take a walk through the village, hoping the quaint sights and sounds will help clear your mind. The cobblestone streets, the smell of freshly baked bread, and the sound of the blacksmith's hammer all speak of a life you know well. Yet, as you pass by the old inn, a weathered poster catches your eye: [b]"Crew Wanted: No Experience Necessary."[/b] A spark of curiosity ignites within you.
<<else>>
You walk through the village, taking in the quiet town. For some reason the cobblestone streets and the familiar sights and sounds no longer carry meaning. You crave something else. As you meander past the inn, once again the weathered poster catches your eye: [b]"Crew Wanted: No Experience Necessary."[/b]
<<endif>>

-> Continue towards the harbor, intrigued by the promise of adventure.
    <<jump The_Path_Not_Taken>>
-> Return home, deciding that today is not the day for decisions.
    <<jump Homecoming_Reflections>>

title: Homecoming_Reflections
---
<<set $returns_home = true>>

Back in the comfort of your home, you sit by the window, watching as the day unfolds. The life of a pirate, full of danger and uncertainty, tempts you, but so does the safety of your current existence. As the sun sets, casting golden hues across the village, you wonder if the call to adventure will ever grow loud enough to drown out the comfort of home.

-> Go for a nice walk.
    <<jump A_Village_Walk>>
-> Venture toward the harbour, the twinkling light inspiring you to seek your destiny.
    <<jump The_Path_Not_Taken>>
-> Decide to stay at home, embracing the life you know.
    <<jump A_Life_Choice_Made>>

===

title: A_Life_Choice_Made
---
You decide that home, with its predictable days and familiar nights, is where you belong. You find solace in the routine and comfort in the known. Years pass, and the tales of the sea become stories you tell, rather than live. Yet, the whisper of what could have been occasionally stirs within you, a reminder of the day you chose safety over adventure. This is the end of your journey. Maybe another life, another day, you'll choose differently.

===

title: The_Path_Not_Taken
---
At the crossroads outside your home, you pause. To the left, the road leads to Port Bellylaugh; to the right, a path winds through the forest, leading to unknown adventures on land. The sea calls to you, but so does the mystery of the unexplored lands that lie beyond Marrow's End.
-> Follow the path to the sea and head towards Port Bellylaugh.
    <<jump The_Call_of_Adventure>>
-> Take the forest path, seeking adventure on solid ground.

The forest path is dense and mysterious, with sunlight filtering through the thick canopy above. You encounter curious creatures and hidden trails that speak of a world untouched by man. The further you venture, the more you realize that adventure comes in many forms, and the call of the unknown is not limited to the sea.
-> Continue deeper into the forest, embracing the wild and unknown.
    <<jump Into_the_Heart_of_the_Forest>>
-> Turn back towards the harbor, your heart still yearning for the sea.
    <<jump The_Call_of_Adventure>>

===

title: Into_the_Heart_of_the_Forest
---
Deep within the forest, you discover a hidden valley, a place of enchantment where time seems to stand still. Here, amongst ancient trees and mystical springs, you find a new calling. The tales of the sea fade into the background as you become a guardian of this secret world, protecting it from those who would seek to exploit its magic. This is the end of your journey. In the heart of the forest, you've found a different kind of adventure, one that fulfills you in ways the sea never could.

===

title: The_Call_of_Adventure
---
You stand at the edge of Port Bellylaugh, eyes alight with the dreams of gold and glory. Before you bobs the The Chuckling Mackerel, a ship known far and wide for its crewâ€™s ability to party harder than they pirate. Captain Bartholomew "Barty" Squawk, a man more myth than reality, is said to be recruiting. Do you dare to join their ranks and seek your fortune?

-> Stride up to the ship with confidence.
    <<jump A_Brave_Approach>>
-> Sneak aboard under the cover of night.
    <<jump A_Sneaky_Start>>
-> Rethink your life choices and become a baker.
    <<jump The_Bakers_Path>>
===

title: Honesty_Approach
---
As you stand before Captain Barty, your heart races. The silence is deafening until you finally speak your truth, admitting your lack of experience but promising dedication and loyalty. The captain studies you for a moment that feels like an eternity. Then, a slow smile spreads across his face. "[i]In a sea of deceit, honesty is a rare treasure,[/i]" he declares. "[i]You're in, but remember, it's not the smooth seas that make skilled sailors. Welcome aboard.[/i]" Your honesty has not only earned you a place among the crew but also the captain's respect. Also, you can't go home again this time.
-> Thank the captain and prepare for your first task.

As you stride towards the ship, a parrot squawks, "[i]Look lively, lads! Fresh meat![/i]" All activity ceases, and several curious, if not entirely sober, eyes turn your way. A figure with a hat so large it seems to defy gravity approaches. "[i]And who might you be?[/i]" they slur slightly.

Seizing a moment of distraction as the crew debates who is the tallest (the [b]demonstrably[/b] shortest member of the crew was winning the debate at your last glance), you slip over the side and into the dark waters below. Freedom tastes like salty seawater and missed opportunities. This is the end of your adventure. Perhaps the sea will call to you again someday.

position: 490,-370
