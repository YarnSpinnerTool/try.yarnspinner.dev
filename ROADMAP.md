# Roadmap

## v0.1 

- [ ] Apply Yarn Spinner visual theme

- [x] Make interactive view scroll, rather than push the height of the page down
- [ ] Show information about registered functions
- [ ] Show explanatory text about the tool
- [ ] Release to Patreon
- [ ] Allow specifying the name of the node you start from (show a dropdown list of valid node names?)

## v0.2

- [ ] Allow dragging and dropping a yarn file / folder into place and running it
- [ ] Make it into a node module so that other projects can use it

## Ideas

- [ ] Download a Unity project with dialogue view of your choice setup, from whatever youâ€™ve been editing
